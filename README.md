## What is Vanilla++:

Vanilla++ is a DayZ workshop add-on which aims to extend the Vanilla experience by implementing a collection of features, and tools which help communities customize their expirence while still allowing for that vanilla DayZ feel.

## Installation:

### Client:

- If you are a player and want to play on Vanilla++ servers, please subscribe to [our steam workshop release](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1578593068), as well as,  our dependency [RPCFramework](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1559212036)

- Use the DayZ Launcher and load @VanillaPlusPlus, and @RPCFramework, or by adding the following to your start-up commandline:
```c
-mod=@RPCFramework;@VanillaPlusPlus;
```

### Server:


- [Download Vanilla++](https://github.com/Da0ne/DZMods/archive/master.zip)
- Go into the servers root folder and unpack the folders ```@VanillaPlusPlus``` and ```mpmissions``` there.
- Go inside of the ```@VanillaPlusPlus``` folder, and copy the contents of the ```Keys``` folder into the ```keys``` folder located in your server's root folder.
- Create a new folder called ```server_profile``` and copy your server config into there (usually called```serverDZ.cfg```) This step can be skipped if you don't wish to use a custom profile folder but it will make it more difficult to edit configuration of the mod!
- Open the copied config file and change 'dayzOffline.chernarusplus' to 'DayZSurvival.chernarusplus'
- Subscribe to [RPCFramework](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1559212036) on the Steam workshop.
- On your DayZ Launcher, go into the ```Mods``` right click ```RPCFramework```, and select open folder. If you are prompted with a warning, click I understand. Copy the ```@RPCFramework``` folder to your servers root folder.
- Go inside the copied folder and copy it's Â´JacobMango.bikeyÂ´ file into the server's keys folder, located in the server root folder.
- Change your startup following start-up commandlines to include
``` -mod=@VanillaPlusPlus;@RPCFramework -config=server_profile\serverDZ.cfg -profiles=server_profile -name=myServerName -scrAllowFileWrite ```

#### ViLAYER:
